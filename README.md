# disc-crash-vid
Discord crash video creator made in node.js using ffmpeg

This only works on Discord for windows, and hardware accleration has to be turned off (i think).

### Needed files:
- Download the [exe on the releases page](https://github.com/foobball/disc-crash-vid/releases/download/1.0/crashmaker.exe)
- Download ffmpeg.exe from their website or [this repository](https://github.com/foobball/disc-crash-vid/raw/main/ffmpeg.exe)
- Download template.mp4 [here](https://github.com/foobball/disc-crash-vid/raw/main/template.mp4)
- mp4 that you will make Discord crash with

### How to use
- Put all the downloaded files together into a directory
- Open cmd in that directory
- Type `crashmaker.exe filename.mp4`, replacing filename.mp4 with the mp4 you want to crash Discord with
- The program will create a file called `output.mp4`

When you upload the file to Discord and play it, it will crash Discord either instantly or when you try to switch channels.
